- ✅ Added session replay (10% sample rate)

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline (100% ✅)
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Added multi-version Node.js testing (18.x, 20.x)
- ✅ Implemented automated testing pipeline
- ✅ Added build and deployment stages
- ✅ Configured Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring
- ✅ Set up staging and production deployment workflows
- ✅ Added coverage reporting with Codecov integration
